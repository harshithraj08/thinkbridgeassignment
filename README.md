2.Install the ionic CLI globally: "npm install -g ionic" 

3.Run "npm install" to install all dependencies.

4.Run "npm install animate.css" to install animate part of our app to create an even richer user experience by using the simple but awesome animate.css.

5.Run "ionic serve" to start the development environment.

6.To build the project run "ionic cordova build android or ionic cordova build ios. In order for you to build an iOS app, you need to run on MacOS.
